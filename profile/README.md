## NaaVRE - Notebook as a Virtual Research Environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are currently reworking the NaaVRE architecture, migrating code from monolytic repositories in the [QCDIS org](https://github.com/orgs/QCDIS/) to fine-grained repositories on the [NaaVRE org](https://github.com/NaaVRE/).

NaaVRE is built by LifeWatch ERIC VLIC and the QCDIS team at the University of Amsterdam. To learn more, visit https://naavre.net.
